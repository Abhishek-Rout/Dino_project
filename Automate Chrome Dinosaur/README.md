# Automate Chrome Dinosaur
  This is a simple python program used to automate the dinosaur in Chrome Dinosaur game to jump and bend according to the given obstacles.
  
## Program Logic
  I have made two notice region in front of the Dinosaur, one at top and other at bottom so that so that whenever an objectacle come in any of the notice region according to that it jumps or bends.
  
## Header files & their use
  - Pyautogui: Used for pressing "up" and "down" keys.
  - PIL -> Image, ImageGrab: Used for image recognition.
  
## Adjustments
  Before running the code do these adjustments:
  - Install the header files.
  - Adjust the pixcel of the notice region acording to the screen resolution/size.
